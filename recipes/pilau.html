    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Pilaf  or pilau is a rice dish, or in some regions, a wheat dish, whose
        recipe usually involves cooking in stock or broth, adding spices, and other ingredients such as vegetables or
        meat, and employing some technique for achieving cooked grains that do not adhere to each
        other.


    </p>
    <p>
        At the time of the <i>Abbasid Caliphate</i>, such methods of cooking rice at first spread through a vast territory from
        India to Spain, and eventually to a wider world. The Valencian (Spanish) <i>paella</i>, and the South Asian
        pilau or pulao, and <i>biryani</i> ,evolved from such dishes.
